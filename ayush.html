            <h1>Ayush Empire</h1>
            <p class="text">
                Ayush Empire is an empire with a huge base that has many homes and builds that everyone can contribute too with a base being named "New Atlantis." The base is made by all of the members of the base that have all contributed in ways that are very useful. Ayush Empire goes to war against Sid Empire every Sunday and the rules can change so make sure to keep updated on the Indicraft Discord server. In war you can not pick up any loot from people that you kill or are killed you have to leave it how it is and move on. The war is a fight for treasure that can change over time and the winning Empire of the war will take the treasure as their own. Raids can also happen between Sid and Ayush empire, but do not expect there to not be any consequences, most of the time there is a consequence for raids, and you need to make sure that you plan the raids very wisely. When there is not war going on, you are still allowed to kill the enemies, and this time you can actually take others loot, and they can take your's, so make sure to always have your guard up when travelling or even joining the server. Make sure you follow most rules and don't steal anything from any chests that aren't yours. Stealing can end up in a ban. No Griefing either, griefing with end up in a ban no matter what. If you destroy someones build on purpose you will be banned with no hesitation, unless it is your own build and you are taking it down for a reason of course. Make sure to not be toxic and try to follow your kings orders and if you cannot for personal or other reasons that have to do with what your doing then please let them know so that they know and understand why you are not following rules. No duping, griefing, or stealing.
