                This Realm is an open realm of creativity and choices, you can always find something to do with your allies and through doing much of what you want. Indicraft is made-up of teams that have different roles to affect the Realm in unique ways. You can Build, fight, Trade, Ally with your friends and much much more. Through our discord you can chat with people, host events and even do stuff such as participating in actual wars that happen almost every Sunday. This realm is full of friendly and non-toxic people that will become friends with you even when you are not allied. Joining what faction you want to be apart of will play a big role in your actions, as that all the factions are different and have different rules. So make sure to choose wisely.
